Q3:
Making a variable static causes it to exist until the end of the program meaning
x would start at 1 and then instead of resetting each iteration it would add 1 to x each time.

Q4:
When x was not static, it was resetting at 1 at the end of each iteration of the pretty()
function. 

Q5:
First, I started by declaring a new int, and then I created a new pointer to an int,
then I set my ptr equal to that of the new int I created which pointed my pointer towards
new int. Address: 0x562537686ed0

Q6:
To print out the address of ptr we need to utilize the & function, to find the Address
of ptr you need to print &ptr. Address: 0x7ffd46ebc780

I see 5 numbers in the output and then I get an error message because used becomes
equal to capacity.

Q10:
I see it run through the for loop 5 times, printing 5 different sets of numbers
and then printing out resized.

Q11:
It goes through resized 5 times without printing any numbers in between and then 
prints 25 random numbers followed by 5 zeroes.
