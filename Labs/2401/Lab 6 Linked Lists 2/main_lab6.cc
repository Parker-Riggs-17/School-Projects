/*************************************************************************
     Lab Assignment 6: This is another lab assignment in working with 
     linked lists. We will be using a struct node, for its simplicity,
     and working with non-member functions here. The main point is to 
     work with the logic of a linked list. Do not be afraid to make 
     drawings on scrap paper.
     
     The prototypes for the functions that you are to implement are
     included. You should uncomment them when you are ready to write 
     the implementation.
